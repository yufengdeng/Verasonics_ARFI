Verasonics Phantom Sequences
============================
Verasonics sequences that work with the C5-2 and upgraded backplane hardware
for software versions >= 3.0.6.

This sequence has been specifically tested with software version 3.0.6 and
3.2.1 using a Philips C5-2 transducer.

User should edit the first few parameters in `SetUpC5_2Shear_wave_MTL.m`,
including the `filedir` path where data will be saved.

An overview of setting up and modifying Verasonics sequences, including the
background for these specific sequences, can be found here:
